1. Write a failing unit test
2. Write the minimum production code to make your test pass
   You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.
      Note the emphasis on production code. You should write the minimum [still real] code and not the minimum silly code to make the test pass.
      For instance, implementing a constant returning what you expect in the test case is probably the simplest code you can write to make the test pass but it's not a "production code" that solves the "real problem."
3. Refactor the code to improve its design (e.g., rename methods or variables, split a method into two for clarity, replace magic numbers, etc.)
4. Go back to  step 1
